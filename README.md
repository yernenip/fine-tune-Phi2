# Fine tuning Microsoft's Phi-2

## Overview

This notebook was developed in Google Colab and run on a A100 GPU. You can also run this on Tesla T4, however you will need to update the tokenize function and the max_length to 1024 in the tokenizer. The notebook is self explanatory, with comments and section headings all through the notebook.

For more detailed explanation of the notebook, you can refer to the blog below.
